# Webpack Babel Boilerplate Starter Code

This repository acts as a boilerplate for creating a Node.js project using ES6. Your ES6 code is translated to ES5 via Webpack and Babel.

## How to Use

First copy the repository: make a new folder on your local machine that will store your project. Next, in your terminal, navigate to your project folder and run the following code:

`git clone https://github.com/christinlepson/webpack-babel-boilerplate.git .`

Then navigate to the repository and run:

`npm install`

After that, you're ready to get coding in ES6. Your code will go in the app.js file and be translated to ES5.

When you're ready to run your project, execute the command:

`npm start`
